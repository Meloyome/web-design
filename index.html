        <h2 style="color: rgb(87, 26, 56);">Origins</h2>
        <p style="color: palevioletred;">Sanrio is a Japanese company created by Shintaro Tsuji that creates cute cartoon animals. The company started out as a silk company that specialized in selling clothing such as scarves. The producers soon began to realize that cute designs led to more sales, so they began using existing cartoon characters for their merchandise. This, however, did not last long as Tsuji wanted to avoid the royalty fees that accompanied preexisting characters. And so a team of designers was created to design new characters for the business. Though not the first, Hello Kitty became the most well-known character to come from the company and produced the most sales.</p>
