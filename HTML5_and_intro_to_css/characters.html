            <h2>Hello Kitty – The Sweetheart of Sanrio!</h2> 
            <p>No Sanrio world is complete without Hello Kitty! She’s a kind, gentle, 
                and cheerful little girl who loves making new friends. She was born 
                in London and has a twin sister named Mimmy, who wears a yellow bow!</p>   
            <p>Hello Kitty adores baking cookies, spending time with her friends,
                 and spreading happiness wherever she goes. She may not have a mouth,
                  but her heart speaks the universal language of friendship and
                  love! </p>   
                  
            <h3>Cinnamoroll – The Fluffy Flying Puppy!</h3>
            <p>Up in the sky, among the fluffy clouds, you’ll find Cinnamoroll! 
                He’s a tiny white puppy with long, floppy ears that help him fly! 
                He was born on a cloud and is as soft as a marshmallow.</p>

            <p>If you love a little bit of mischief, then Kuromi is your girl! 
                She may seem tough with her black jester hat and skull accessory
                , but deep down, she’s just a fun-loving sweetheart.</p>
            <p>Kuromi loves writing in her diary, reading romance novels, 
                and playing harmless pranks. She may act a little rebellious, but 
                she has a big heart and truly cares about her friends! </p>

                 always wearing her signature red (or sometimes pink!) hood. She
                  treasures time with her best friend Flat the mouse and loves baking 
                  cookies with her grandma.</p>
