           <h2>Welcome to my music page—a space where I share some of my favorite tracks, albums, and artists. Music has always been a big part of my life, shaping moods, memories, and creativity in ways nothing else can. The songs here are ones that have stuck with me, whether for their lyrics, sound, or the way they make me feel. I’m drawn to indie tunes, dreamy lo-fi beats, and anything with a rhythm that lingers long after the music stops. Some tracks are perfect for late-night drives, others for getting lost in thought, and a few just make the world feel a little more cinematic.

            This page is a collection of sounds that inspire me, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you too. Whether you’re looking for something new to add to your playlist or just curious about what I’ve been listening to, take your time and explore.</h2>

            <h1>No Blues</h1>
            <p>This is my all time favorite Los Campesinos album. I feel like its one of those albums where you have to get into the band before you can fully enjoy it. Not to brag but I have a signed copy and it is literaly my most prized possession lol.</p>

            <h1>Give Up</h1>
            <p>I was contemplating putting a 'Death Cab For Cutie' album here because the lead singers of each band are the same, but this whole album is perfect like the other two. My favorite song from the album is 'Sleep In.' </p>
