                    Welcome to my music page—a space where I share some of my favorite tracks, albums, and artists. Music has always been a big part of my life, shaping moods, memories, and creativity in ways nothing else can. 
                    The songs here are ones that have stuck with me, whether for their lyrics, sound, or the way they make me feel. 
                    I’m drawn to indie tunes, dreamy lo-fi beats, and anything with a rhythm that lingers long after the music stops. 
                    Some tracks are perfect for late-night drives, others for getting lost in thought, and a few just make the world feel a little more cinematic.

                    This page is a collection of sounds that inspire me, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you too. 
                    Whether you’re looking for something new to add to your playlist or just curious about what I’ve been listening to, take your time and explore.

                    <p>
                        This is my all-time favorite Los Campesinos album. I feel like it's one of those albums where you have to get into the band before you can fully enjoy it. 
                        Not to brag, but I have a signed copy, and it is literally my most prized possession lol.

                    <p>
                        This album is by TV Girl, and every song on it is absolutely perfect. I would recommend it to anyone. 
                        My favorite track from the album is "For You."

                        I was contemplating putting a 'Death Cab For Cutie' album here because the lead singers of each band are the same, 
                        but this whole album is perfect like the other two. My favorite song from the album is "Sleep In."
